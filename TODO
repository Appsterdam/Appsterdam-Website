- Remove cancel link from members/edit, because there's nothing to cancel and add a remove account action.
- Use form helpers in members/edit.
- Think of better way to express Member#work_location (the design html uses `where') and Member#work_types.
- Do we need a helper that formats the user's web site url properly?
- Autolink @handle in member bio?
- Create actual 401/403 html pages
- Figure out the proper way to add routes in tests
