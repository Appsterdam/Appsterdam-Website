- Currently when reporting a member as spam the page is reloaded, thus possibly making it harder to report a string of spammers.
- Test that members that are marked as spam can't circumbvent it by signing up again.
- Remove all spam markings once a member has been flagged as not being spam?
- Possibly optimize the SpamMarkingsController#index action, but it's not critical.
- Remove cancel link from members/edit, because there's nothing to cancel.
- Place `delete listing' action button in the right place.
- Think of better way to express Member#work_location (the design html uses `where') and Member#work_types.
- Do we need a helper that formats the user's web site url properly?
- Autolink @handle in member bio?
- Create actual 401/403 html pages
- Figure out the proper way to add routes in tests
